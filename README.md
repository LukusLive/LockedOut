Synopsis

This is a project that keeps track of game lockouts (instances, world quests, etc).

Motivation

This is a project that i started as an initial replacement for the dungeon and raid lockouts for each character.  It grew out of SavedInstances becoming a dead addon, and the code licensing being restrictive enough that it could not be copied , pasted and renamed.

Where it goes, i don't know.  My goal is to make sure that if it ever does get to the point where i no longer want to maintain it, that someone else is able to easily take over and continue the work.  It's open so that anyone that wants to can add a feature here or there or even fix bugs.

Contributors

So far it has been me and SacredDuckWhale - but if there are any others that contribute, i will also try to make sure that your contribution is noted.
